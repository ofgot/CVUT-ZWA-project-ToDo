# ZWA_CVUT_ToDo
This project is a website, which includes functionality for managing notes. After login (login.php) or signup (registration.php) user redirect to his notes page (notes.php). Notes are paginated and shown 3 per page. There user can add, delete or edit his notes. The server handles the creation of a new note when the 'Create note' button is pressed (adding empty note), and it also handles the deletion of a note when the 'delete' button is pressed. After performing these actions, the script redirects the user to the appropriate page. The editing of notes on the client side implemented by dynamically replacing note content with an editable form and then saving the changes to the server using a Fetch API request.
